# CS 128 Honors Final Project: Order Book

Group Name: KL Coders

Group Members: Yifan Luo (yifan65), Suhaan Khan (suhaank2)

## Project Introduction
Consider when you want to buy a stock at a specific price, how is your trade fulfilled by the exchange? This is done by an order book, which lists the current buy orders (bids) and the sell orders (asks) for a specific asset. This can include stocks, crypto, commodities, futures, derivatives, or essentially anything that can be traded, and this mechanism is used by nearly every financial exchange/institution.

Modern orderbooks show the price buyers and sellers are willing pay and the units that they are willing to buy or sell. The exchange uses this information to match the interested buyers and sellers, making trades possible.

The scope of this project is to implement a limit order book and simple trade matching in Rust.
